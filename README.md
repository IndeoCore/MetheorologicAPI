# Project challenge
  The project will be develop in duo (Jo√£o and Tiago), in this repository, separating what part each one of us will work on. This API aims to create an endpoint which, with a GET request, we are going to identify a person location and return the value of the temperature in the city. For other applications, we can use our creativity and try to think outside the box.

# Technology
  We are going to use Crystal-lang to develop this project

# Day 1

## Schedule (21/07/2024)

At first, we will use the tips that has been given to us.

We will start by searching together this topics:
- What is an API. *
- What are endpoints. *

We decide to start with these because it will be the most important information that we will obtain at the beginning.

After that, we will then search about Free APIS (and metheorologic ones).

## What we have learnt today (21/07/2024)

We learned that API, in a nutshell, basically is a smaller system that allows the user to interact with a larger system to receive informations or to use valuable applications that this system provides.

We also learned that endpoint is the way that you can acess these API, an adress. Its structure is very detailed and it is an important thing to learn at first, so we can acess the APIs properly.

While searching about APIs, we discovered some very useful free options that we can use:

- Correios (CEP information)
- Google Maps (Location services)
- Spotify (Music information)
- OpenWheater (**Free Metheorologic API**)
